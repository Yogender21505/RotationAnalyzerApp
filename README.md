# Rotation Analyser

Rotation Analyser is an Android application that allows users to analyze the rotation data of their device. It provides visual representations of the pitch, roll, and yaw angles over time, helping users understand how their device is oriented.

## Features

- Real-time display of device rotation angles: Pitch, Roll, and Yaw using accelerometer sensor.
- Historical data visualization: View historical rotation data in graphical charts.
- Export data: Save rotation data to a text file for further analysis.
